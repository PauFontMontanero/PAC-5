## üíª System Requirements

- Windows Operating System
- .NET 8.0 or higher
- Visual Studio 2022 (for development)
- At least 50MB of free disk space
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended

## ‚ú® Features

### Basic Operations
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Support for chained operations
- Operator precedence handling (* and / before + and -)

### Advanced Operations
- Power operations (^)
- Square root calculations (‚àö)
- Parentheses support with multiple nesting levels
- Complex expression evaluation

### User Interface
- Error handling for invalid operations

## üì• Installation Guide

1. Download the MSI installer from the latest release
2. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
3. Launch the calculator from the created desktop shortcut or start menu

For developers:
1. Clone the repository: git clone [repository-url]
2. Open the solution file (PAC5-Calculadora.sln) in Visual Studio 2022
3. Build the solution (Ctrl + Shift + B)
4. Run the application (F5)

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Starting the Calculator
- Launch the application from the desktop shortcut or start menu
- The calculator window will appear with a clean display

### Basic Operations
- Enter numbers using the on-screen buttons or your keyboard's NumPad
- Use operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations
- Press '=' or Enter to see the result
- Press 'C' to clear the display and start over

### Advanced Operations

Using Parentheses:
- Use ( ) to group operations
- Supports nested parentheses
- Example: (5 + 3) * 2 = 16

Power Operations:
- Use ^ for power calculations
- Example: 2 ^ 3 = 8

Square Root:
- Use ‚àö for square root calculations
- Example: ‚àö 16 = 4

### Error Handling
The calculator handles various error scenarios:
- Division by zero
- Invalid square root operations (negative numbers)
- Unmatched parentheses
- Missing operators between terms
- Invalid operation combinations

## üí° Examples

Basic Calculation:
Input: 5 + 3 =
Output: 8

Advanced Operations:
Input: (5 + 3) * 2 =
Output: 16

Input: 2 ^ 3 =
Output: 8

Input: ‚àö 16 =
Output: 4

Complex Expressions:
Input: 3 + 5 * (2 ^ 3) - ‚àö 16 =
Output: 39

Error Handling:
Input: ‚àö -4 =
Output: Error (Cannot calculate square root of negative number)

Input: 5 + (3 * 2 =
Output: Error (Unmatched parentheses)
